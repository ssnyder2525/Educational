		<h1>Hiking</h1>
		<p>Hiking is an easy and fun activity for families or individuals. Canyons and woods can be very fun to hike
		if you are not looking for heavy activity, while longer trips such as kings peak may take several days to
		hike.</p>
		<p>No matter where you hike, it is recommended that you take plenty of water and another person with you.
		Although accidents are not tremendously common, it is never safe to hike alone in places where a dangerous
		situation may present itself.</p
